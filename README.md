Queue Fight!

There are 5 types of the people to stand for a big chunk of TOFU not ordinary one. Special golden tofu created by John Rambo, some really kick ass tofu. The store is not so big and can fit only up to 20 person.
  Karate Man
  Blond girl with blue eyes
  Barbarian
  Science girl from NASA
  Hipis
Customers comes 1 by 1 and every time someone new appears the order in the queue changes because:
If it is not explicitly said rules applies only for persons that are next to the mentioned group or man type.
Karate man always wins with Hipis since he is nothing for him. Barbarian wins with Karate man since he is using brute force and puts him behind his back. Science girl wins with Blond girl by convincing her that if she will stand behind her because some pink pony will come to be her pet for eternity. But if the two or more blond girls stand next to each other they become really powerful against Karate man who cannot opose them and let them stand before him but normally Karate man is so devoted to his rules he will not budge. Hipis also lose to blond girls. But if hipis stays next to the hipis new hipis will get to the front. Barbarian cannot win with girl from NASA since she gives him a headache during the talk. But if 10 Hipises stand on the end of the line they merge their brains with hipis prayer and find a way to be first in the queue. Two barbarians next to each other creates a deadly mixture, only one leader of the hord can exist. Also hipis loses with barbarian and NASA girl.
